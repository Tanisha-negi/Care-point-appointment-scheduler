          What is this doctor appointment scheduler and how does it work?
          <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Our doctor appointment scheduler is an online platform that allows
          patients to easily book, reschedule, or cancel appointments with
          healthcare professionals. Instead of calling the clinic or waiting in
          line, patients can search for doctors by specialty, location, or
          availability and confirm appointments within a few clicks. Once a
          booking is made, both the patient and doctor receive confirmation and
          reminders to reduce the chances of missed appointments.

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, patients are required to create an account before booking an
          appointment. This ensures that your medical history, past
          appointments, and future bookings are safely stored in one place.
          Having an account also allows you to manage multiple appointments,
          receive reminders, and access secure medical notes from your doctor.
          Signing up is free and only requires basic details like your name,
          email, and phone number.

        <div class="answer">
          Absolutely. Our system supports “Family Profiles,” which means you can
          manage appointments not only for yourself but also for your children,
          parents, or other dependents. Each profile can be linked under one
          account, so you don’t need to create separate logins. This makes it
          convenient to schedule multiple visits without confusion.

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          You can search for doctors using filters such as specialty (e.g.,
          cardiologist, dentist, dermatologist), location, consultation type
          (online or in-clinic), and availability. Each doctor’s profile
          contains detailed information including qualifications, years of
          experience, clinic address, and patient reviews. This helps you make
          an informed decision before confirming an appointment.

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, every doctor listed on our platform goes through a strict
          verification process. We verify their medical license, registration
          with relevant medical councils, and credentials before they are
          allowed to offer services on our platform. Patient safety and trust
          are our top priorities, so you can be confident that all doctors are
          genuine healthcare professionals.

        <div class="answer">
          You can book both in-clinic and online (video/phone) consultations
          depending on the doctor’s availability. Online consultations are
          especially useful for follow-ups, minor health concerns, or when
          traveling. In-clinic visits are recommended for physical examinations
          or treatments that cannot be done virtually. Each doctor clearly
          mentions which types of appointments they offer.

        <div class="answer">
          Yes, you will automatically receive reminders via email, SMS, or push
          notifications (if you enable them). Reminders are usually sent 24
          hours before and again 1–2 hours before the scheduled appointment.
          This ensures you don’t miss your consultation. For online
          consultations, you’ll also receive the video call link in your

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, our system is flexible and allows you to cancel or reschedule
          appointments easily. However, the exact policy depends on the doctor’s
          clinic. Some doctors allow free cancellations up to 24 hours before
          the appointment, while others may have a cancellation fee. All
          policies are clearly displayed before you confirm your booking so
          there are no surprises later.

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Creating an account and browsing doctors is completely free. The only
          cost involved is the consultation fee charged by the doctor, which you
          will see clearly before confirming your appointment. Some clinics may
          also offer packages, health plans, or discounts for online payments.
          Our platform itself does not charge extra service fees to patients for
          booking appointments.

          We use advanced encryption and secure servers to store all your

          Email or phone verification ensures that your account is secure and

        <div class="answer">
          While booking, you’ll need to provide your name, age, gender, contact
          details, and any relevant medical history. This helps the doctor
          prepare for your consultation. For online consultations, ensure that
          your device has a working camera, microphone, and a stable internet
          connection.

          You can reschedule an appointment by going to the “My Appointments”
          section in your account. Choose the appointment you want to change,
          then select a new date and time from the doctor’s available slots. If
          rescheduling is within the allowed time frame (usually 24 hours before
          the consultation), no extra charge will apply.

          Yes, you can cancel appointments as long as it falls within the

          eligibility (if any) before confirming the cancellation. Refunds are
          typically processed within 5–7 working days.

          If you miss your appointment without canceling in advance, the
          consultation fee may not be refunded. However, you can still rebook

          partial refunds or free rescheduling in exceptional cases, but this
          depends on their policy.

          Yes, you can book appointments for family members by adding them under

          There’s no strict limit on the number of appointments you can book.
          You can schedule multiple appointments for yourself and your family
          members as long as they don’t overlap. However, each appointment needs
          to be confirmed individually to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy in
          the doctor’s schedule.
